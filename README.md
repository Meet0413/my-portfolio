# Meet Kanani - Portfolio Website 🌐

Hey there 👋, welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
This site is a showcase of my journey as a **Data Scientist, Python Developer, and Web Enthusiast**.  
I built it to highlight my **skills, projects, and experience**, and to make it easy for people to connect with me.
